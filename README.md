# ip-puller-website-to-discord-webhook

all you need to do is put the script on your website and change where it says DISCORD_WEBHOOK_HERE to your discord webhook

this is just for proof of concept i am not responsible for anything done with this 

i created a script that you can add to the html in your website all you ahve to do is copy and paste and put in your discord webhook and its done sorry for the name of the repository had no idea what to name this

i will be updating this script when i add new things to it for myself but it works fine now so dont expect too many updates
